add 
mobility-helper 
animation-interface
netanim-module.h
in all programs along with header files from simple-global-routing and rip programs





























FOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
put ".......... \n" at the end for delayed printing statements
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
if wrong output gain and again just use different port number

include memset in programs if output comes wrong



TCP
int client_fid=accept(fid,NULL,NULL);  ----- need not give client address in serve side

UDP
server side:
bind should ve done in udp also
int len=sizeof(client_address);
int n=recvfrom(fid, msg, sizeof(msg), 0, (struct sockaddr *) &client_address, &len);
sendto(fid, msg, n, 0, (struct sockaddr *) &client_address, len);
client side:
int length=sizeof(server_address);
sendto(network_fid, msg, strlen(msg), 0, (struct sockaddr *) &server_address, sizeof(server_address));
recvfrom(network_fid, msg, sizeof(msg), 0, (struct sockaddr *) &server_address, &length);




CHAT SERVER and CLIENT
add while loop,memset and exit condition in TCP without changing allignment

MULTICLIENT
server side:
in while loop include 
clients[n]=client_fid;
n++;
The pthread_create should send NULL in second place and no & for receive function
client side:
fgets(msg,250,stdin)>0 should be the while loop condition in main
fputs should be used to print the output in the receive function
The pthread_create should send NULL in second place and & for receive function
argc is int and argv is character pointer. syntax is int main(int argc, char* argv[])



STOP AND WAIT   &    GO BACK N
without changing the allignment change char to int and add exit condition in chat without exit condition
in scanf, send, read, memset use &msg and sizeof(msg)




DVR
IN every for loop both dist and from should be present
